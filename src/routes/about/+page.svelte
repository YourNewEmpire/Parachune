  <h1 id="about-heading">Why Parachune</h1>
  <p>
    The ideaüí°: We have a simple application on desktops üñ•Ô∏è and mobiles üì± for
    artists and listeners to use. No advertisement, no middle men, no paywalls.
  </p>
  <p>
    FULL focus on the music community. Direct donations to users/artists. Free
    usage for all. This is the problem we solve for you: a site to showcase your
    music for free with no limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an experienced web developer, I have a clue about how to build fast,
    beautiful web applications and, how to deploy them globally with little cost
    and high availabilty. So why not put that to good use?
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than a fixed monthly subscription, you can donate what you can, when
    you can, to the platform or to an artist.
  </p>
  <p>
    We want a peaceful community for people to share their music on comfortably.
  </p>

  <h1>How will this work?</h1>
  <p>
    With popularity, kind donations will cover the costs of the app. No user has
    set limits, everyone is included.
  </p>

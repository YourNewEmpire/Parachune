  <h1 id="about-heading">Why Parachune</h1>
  <p>
    The ideaüí°: We have a simple application on desktops üñ•Ô∏è and mobiles üì± for
    artists and listeners to use. No advertisement, no middle men, no paywalls.
  </p>
  <p>
    FULL focus on the music community. Direct donations to users. Free usage for
    all.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an experienced web developer, I have a clue about how to build fast,
    beautiful web applications and, how to deploy them globally with little cost
    and high availabilty. So why not put that to good use?
  </p>
  <p>
    As oppose to having a fixed monthly subscription, you can donate what you
    can, when you can, to the platform or to an artist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Artists of all sizes can lose the thought of having a "label", and release
    music freely. Your music is yours here, not Parachunes, we just convey your
    music for you.
  </p>

  <h1>How will this work?</h1>
  <p>With popularity, donations will cover the costs of the app.</p>

  <h1>Meet the team? Oh we need a team.</h1>
  <p>I am Archie, the developer and creator of the project.</p>
  <p>
    If you want to volunteer and help this project, here are some skills we
    need:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Graphic design</li>
    <li>
      Web development (I may need help or guidance adding non-trivial features
      to the stack)
    </li>
    <li>community moderators and artist relations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>...And probably much more, as this is a community effort.</p>
